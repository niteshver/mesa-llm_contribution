# Getting Started
Mesa-llm is an extension of the Mesa agent-based modeling framework that enables language-model-based reasoning inside agents, while preserving Mesa’s execution model, scheduling, and environments.

Mesa-llm allows agents to reason using natural language prompts, enabling more flexible, interpretable, and adaptive decision-making within structured simulations.

Agents in mesa-llm are still standard Mesa agents. The only difference is how decisions are made, not how models run.

## Overview
If you want a high-level understanding of mesa-llm structure and capabilities, start here:

## Tutorials
If you want to learn mesa-llm step by step, follow these tutorials:
- [Creating your First Mesa-llm Model](https://github.com/mesa/mesa-llm/blob/main/docs/first_model.md)
Learn how to define a minimal LLMAgent that reasons using an LLM while remaining a standard Mesa agent.

- [Negotiation Model Tutorial](https://github.com/mesa/mesa-llm/blob/main/docs/negotiation_model_tutorial.md)
Learn how multiple LLM-powered agents reason, communicate, and negotiate within a shared model.

## Examples
Mesa-llm ships with example models demonstrating how language-based reasoning integrates with classic agent-based modeling patterns.

These examples are useful if you are already familiar with Mesa and want to see how LLM-powered agents behave in practice. You can find them here:
