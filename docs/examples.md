# Examples

The examples folder contains LLM agent-based models implemented using Mesa-LLM. They serve as  demonstrations of Mesa-LLM's capabilities and starting points for your own models.

This folder contains both basic and advanced examples that demonstrate different aspects of Mesa-LLM.

## Epstein Civil Violence Model

Joshua Epstein's [model](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.092080199) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.

**Location:** [examples/epstein_civil_violence](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-llm/tree/main/examples/epstein_civil_violence)

This example demonstrates:
- Agent decision-making based on social dynamics
- LLM-powered agent reasoning in conflict scenarios
- Integration of multiple agent types with different behaviors

## Negotiation Model

Implementation of a negotiation model where two types of agents (buyer and seller) negotiate over a product.

**Location:** [examples/negotiation](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-llm/tree/main/examples/negotiation)

This example demonstrates:
- Agent-to-agent communication
- LLM-based negotiation strategies
- Dynamic pricing and offer-counteroffer mechanisms
